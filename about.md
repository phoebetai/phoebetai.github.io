Hi, I'm Phoebe. I currently study CS at University of Maryland, College Park. I'm particularly interested in the areas of parallel computing, IOT/embedded systems, and computer vision/real-world modeling.


This site is intended to be an online resume of sorts, where I can discuss my projects and interests in greater detail than a standard one-page resume (or LinkedIn) allows :)
